    Act as an expert technical writer. Based on the following code diff, generate a high-level feature document in Markdown. Include:
    1.  **Summary of Changes**: A high-level overview of what was changed.
    2.  **New Features / Fixes**: A bulleted list of new features added or bugs fixed.
    3.  **How to Use**: If new functions or components were added, provide a simple code example.
    4.  **Visual Flowchart**: Generate a Mermaid syntax flowchart for any new complex logic.

    Act as a senior developer performing a code review. Based on the following diff, provide a detailed, file-by-file breakdown of the changes in Markdown. For each file, explain:
    1.  **Code Delta**: Detail the differences between the old and new code.
    2.  **Technical Reasoning**: Infer the reason for the change (e.g., "refactored for efficiency," "fixed a null reference bug," "added error handling").
