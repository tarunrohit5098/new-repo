## Code Review: `sample.py`

This commit introduces a new file, `sample.py`, which implements a hybrid approach to processing payslip data from PDF documents.  It uses Google Document AI for OCR and a large language model (LLM, specifically Llama 3 via Ollama) for data structuring.

**1. Code Delta:**

The entire file (`sample.py`) is newly added.  It contains two main functions:

*   `create_llm_prompt(full_document_text: str, desired_json_example: str) -> str:` This function constructs a prompt for the LLM, including instructions, an example JSON structure, and the extracted text from the PDF.  The prompt is designed to guide the LLM to output a JSON object representing the payslip data.

*   `process_payslip_with_llm(project_id: str, location: str, processor_id: str, file_path: str, llm_api_base: str) -> Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]:` This function orchestrates the entire process. It first uses the Google Document AI API to extract text from a PDF file. Then, it uses the `create_llm_prompt` function to generate a prompt and sends it to the Ollama LLM (Llama 3). Finally, it processes the LLM's response, attempting to parse it as JSON and handling potential errors.  Crucially, it includes new debugging code to print the full document text and the raw LLM output.

**2. Technical Reasoning:**

The code implements a hybrid approach to solve a complex problem: extracting structured data from unstructured PDF payslips.  The rationale is as follows:

*   **OCR and Text Extraction:** Google Document AI is used for its robust OCR capabilities, handling variations in document formatting and quality. This is a crucial first step to get raw textual data.
*   **LLM for Data Structuring:** Using an LLM like Llama 3 is necessary because simply extracting text is insufficient.  The LLM is able to understand the context of the text, identify individual payslips (even across multiple pages), extract relevant fields, and structure the information into a consistent JSON format.  The detailed prompt with an example helps guide the LLM's output.
*   **Error Handling:** The code includes extensive error handling to catch exceptions during the process (e.g., `json.JSONDecodeError`, network errors).  This ensures robustness and provides informative error messages.
*   **Debugging Enhancements:** The addition of debugging code to print the full extracted text and the raw LLM output is a significant improvement. This makes debugging and troubleshooting significantly easier.
*   **Clear Function Definitions:** The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and type hints, improving readability and maintainability.

**Overall Assessment:**

The code is well-written, uses appropriate libraries, and addresses the problem effectively. The inclusion of error handling and debugging aids significantly improves its robustness and maintainability. The hybrid approach, leveraging the strengths of both Google Document AI and an LLM, is a smart and effective strategy for this complex data extraction task.  The prompt engineering seems well-considered, clearly instructing the LLM on the desired output format and handling edge cases.  The regular expression used to extract the JSON from the LLM response is a practical solution to handle potential extraneous text in the response.

**Suggestions:**

*   **Configuration:** Consider moving hardcoded values like API keys and project IDs to configuration files (e.g., `.env` files) to improve security and maintainability.
*   **Logging:** Implement proper logging using a logging library (like Python's `logging` module) to record events and errors for better monitoring and debugging.
*   **Unit Testing:**  Add unit tests to verify the functionality of each function, especially error handling paths.  This would significantly enhance confidence in the code's correctness.


The addition of this file represents a substantial and well-executed piece of functionality. The approach is sound, the code is well-written, and the debugging enhancements are very welcome.
